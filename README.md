pypass
~~~~~~

Simple team password management using gpg.

pypass is heavily inspired by the shell-script `pass', but it rewritten in Python 3 for better cross-platform compatibility (in particlar, it should work on, and has been tested on Windows without Cygwin).

At the moment, it does most of what pass does, but does not manage the git repository for you (coming soon).
